# Der Homberger App

This app helps drivers of a local public transport company to always have their timetables and company letters such as newsletters with them. 

The app is based on a PDF system. Administrators can upload PDFs and set them as either general or line-specific. Riders can then retrieve these PDFs or even be notified in advance of the upload through push notifications.

## Demo

I will happily show you the app in person or via call - please note that I can't hand out the login information because the PDFs stored can contain secret information.
